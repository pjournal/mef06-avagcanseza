    "text": "4.1 Tidyverse\nWhen I started to watch conference talk that I mentioned above, I realized I could do anything related to data wrangling I did so far in Pegasus by using R. So, I decided to elaborate on this article. Tidyverse has 8 core packages named ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr and forcats.\n\nData Visualization and Exploration\n\n\nggplot2 is used to create data visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, error charts, etc.\n\n\nData Wrangling and Transformation\n\n\nDplyr is known for data manipulation. It has five important functions namely mutate(), select(), filter(), summarise() and arrange(). These functions are used with group_by().\nTidyr helps create clean data.\nStringr has many functions for data cleaning and data preparation. All functions in this library starts with “str” and take a string vector as a first argument.\nForcats handles issues like changes the orders of values in vectors, reordering the vectors, etc.\n\n\nData Import and Management\n\n\nReadr helps read rectangular data such as that with file formats tsv, csv, delim, fwf, etc. in a simple and speedy way.\nTibble is a form of a data.frame which includes the useful parts of it and discards the parts that are not so important.\n\n\nFunctional Programming\n\n\nPurrr turns messed-up codes into simpler ones.\n\nArticle : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-tidyverse-packages-in-r-language/"

    "text": "4.2 Uncover the R Applications\nI watched many conference talks so that I could chose one for this assignment. These talks make me wonder why R Programming Language is used by top companies from various industries like banking, e-commerce, finance, etc.\nApplications of R Programming :\n\nFinance : R helps financial institutions perform downside risk measurement, adjust risk performance and utilize visualizations like candlestick charts, density plots, drawdown plots, etc. Time-series statistical processes of R are used to model the movement of financial industries’ stock-market and predict the prices of shares. R provides financial data mining capabilities through its packages like quantmod, pdfetch, TFX, pwt, etc. Rshiny helps extract data from online assets.\nBanking : R is most widely used for credit risk modeling and other forms of risk analytics. Hadoop is an ally of R in the fields like analysis of customer quality, customer segmentation, and retention.\nHealthcare : R helps perform pre-clinical trials and analyze the drug-safety data. R is also used for statistical modeling in the field of epidemiology, where data scientists analyze and predict the spread of diseases.\nSocial Media : Some of the important statistical tools like sentiment analysis and other forms of social media data mining are used with R. Social media is used for potential customer segmentation and targeting them as new customers.\nE-commerce : E-commerce companies use R is for analyzing cross-selling products to their customers. Various statistical procedures like linear modeling are necessary to analyze the purchases made by the customers as well as in predicting product sales. Furthermore, companies use R for carrying out A/B testing analysis across the pages of their products.\nManufacturing : Analyzing customer sentiment helps them optimize their product according to trending consumer interests and also to match their production volume to varying market demand. They also use R to minimize their production costs and maximize profits.\n\nArticle : https://data-flair.training/blogs/r-applications/"

The project is done to find out that how informative ingredients are for determining price of skincare products. Hypothesis is brand will be much more informative than ingredients to predict the price of a product. It’s an end-to-end analysis project from data analysis to machine learning algorithm validation. The researcher mentions about experimental limitations of the project. It is concluded the higher prices in skincare products does not mean higher quality skincare ingredients. You can go over details of analysis in the link below.\nArticle : https://towardsdatascience.com/data-analysis-ingredients-of-skincare-products-not-found-to-affect-product-price-c3593d123a4d"
