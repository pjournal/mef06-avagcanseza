## Data Wrangling

First of all, I installed packages.

```{r,output=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(openxlsx)

options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```

I fetched raw data and stored in **students** variable.

```{r}
students<-read_excel("docs/foreign_students_by_nationality_2021_2022.xlsx")
```

I high-level look at raw data which has 7 columns and 10.461 rows.

```{r}
students %>% glimpse()
```

I changed column names so that I could omit white spaces and Turkish characters.

```{r}
new_cols <- c("university","university_type","country","nationality","male","female","total")

colnames(students) <- new_cols
```

I removed any incomplete cases.

```{r}
students <- na.omit(students) 
```

I selected columns from **university** to **female**.

```{r}
students <- students %>%
  select('university':'female')
```

I unpivoted male and female column as **gender** column by using **melt** function.

```{r}
students <- reshape2::melt(students, id = c("university", "university_type", "country", "nationality"), variable.name = "gender", value.name="count")
```

I converted count column as numeric.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
students$count <- as.numeric(students$count)
```

I saved file as **RDS**.

```{r}
saveRDS(data, file = "apps/foreign_students_app/students.Rds")
```

I created another excel file named **foreign_students.xlsx** derived from raw data. I used this file in shiny app.

```{r}
write.xlsx(students, "ForeignStudentAnalysis/foreign_students.xlsx")
```

## Shinyapps.io

## Command for local running

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub(repo = "pjournal/mef06-avagcanseza",subdir="apps/foreign_students_app")
```
